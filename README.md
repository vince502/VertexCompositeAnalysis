# VertexCompositeAnalysisSeveral remarks:- The NTuple producer only works for D0. The two layer decay like  `LamC->KsP->PiPiP` can not be analyzed.- The MVA calculations and selections must be done in the stage of  `VertexCompositeSelector`. The MVA calculations in `D0FitterNew`  and `VertexCompositeAnalyzer` are wrong because the ordering of MVA  variables are wrong.- A `VtxProb` cut were applied at the `D0FitterNew`. But I do not  think this has significant impact at the signal.- Run```cmsRun VertexCompositeProducer/test/pPbSkimAndTree2016_D0Both_BDT_ForLamC_cfg.pycmsRun VertexCompositeProducer/test/pPbSkimAndTree2016_D0Both_BDT_MC_ForLamC_cfg.py```
